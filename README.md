# Project Name: Environmental Hazard Risk Predictor

## Overview

This project is a web-based platform that analyzes residential properties and environmental data to identify areas at risk for chemical hazards. By combining housing features with environmental incident data, we aim to help identify communities that may be exposed to hazardous materials such as asbestos, lead paint, or toxic chemical spills.

## Features

#### Housing Analysis:

- Analyze homes by size, age, and other structural features.

- Identify properties that are more likely to contain asbestos insulation or lead paint.

#### Chemical Incident Database:

- Incorporate data on toxic chemical spills or leaks.

- Track the cause, mitigation efforts, spread radius, and death toll of each incident.

#### Risk Prediction:

- Predict cities and communities at higher risk of chemical exposure.

- Offer suggestions on how to mitigate potential hazards based on historical patterns.

## Goals

- Raise awareness about environmental health risks in residential and/or populated areas.

- Provide tools for first responders, urban planners, and residents to proactively address chemical safety.

- Support informed decision-making when it comes to housing and community health.

Technologies Used

- Frontend technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

- Backend/database for incident tracking and housing data

- Data analytics and machine learning for prediction

## Future Plans

- Expand dataset to include real-time incident reporting.

- Integrate satellite imagery and geospatial data.

- Build a dashboard for local agencies to visualize community risk levels.

## How to Use

Navigate to the homepage, select or preset a residential address or region, and view risk assessment based on housing data and nearby chemical incidents. Also, explore recommendations for how people ranging from residents to emergency responders can mitigate chemical risks.
